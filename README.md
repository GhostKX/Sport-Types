```

## Code Structure 

- **Class Data**: Class details (class number, letter, and room number) are stored in dictionaries, with separate dictionaries for each property (number, letter, room) and a combined dictionary ```class_all``` for easy management.
- **Room Management:**: The system ensures rooms are not double-booked by checking the availability of the room before assigning a class to it.
